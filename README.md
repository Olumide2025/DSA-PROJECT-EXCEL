### üß† Skills & Competencies Demonstrated
Skills and How it was applied
- Data Cleaning: I removed nulls, corrected inconsistent formats, trimmed text
- Data Aggregation: I used pivot tables and grouping in summarizing the key insights
- Excel Formulas	IF, COUNTIF, AVERAGEIFS, PROPER, TRIM and calculated columns
- Visualization Designed intuitive charts (bar, pie, line, donut, cards)
- Slicers & Cards	was enabled tp help in the dynamic filtering and KPI display of insights
- Business Analysis: Conclusions were drawn based on data trends and business logic

### üí° Summary of Business Insight
- High Discount is not equal to High Rating: Many discounted items witnessed poor ratings. cutting down prices alone won‚Äôt ensure customer satisfaction, they need more assurance.
- Most Reviewed Category: Electronics stands as the most reviewed product category which shows high satisfaction.
- Revenue Optimization: More focus should be on marketing mid-priced, highly rated products in "Home Kitchen" and "Accessories".
- Product Opportunity: Products with moderate ratings but high volume reviews may benefit from improved quality or targeted feedback campaigns.
- Outlier Products: A few products drive massive engagement. Promoting these further can help with cross-selling.
